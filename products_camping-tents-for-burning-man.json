We had some neighbors who were virgins as well and went with a large hexayurt. They arrived in the middle of a moderate sandstorm at night and the eight of them simply could not put it together. They were all swearing at each other within 20 minutes because the wind was blowing them around so much. Even with mild winds and neighborly help the next day, they still struggled. I'm pretty confident that my amigo and I could have the kodiak up in about 15 minutes or less, even in very windy conditions (I know, Murphy will bite my ass for saying that).\n\nSooo... I would definitely give thumbs up for the kodiak.",

Solid, air tight and big enough to store gear, walk around in and get out of the elements. It gets hot, you will need some sort of shade over it. I recommend camo or something that doesn't make flap sounds in the wind. Invest in long solid tent stakes. This is thee tent in my opinion. Worth every penny. I also added some cheap carpet to keep what little dust that camp in on the ground. Also I didn't use the awning- I folded it down and attached it to the ground poles to keep the dust from coming in and for extra security while I was away. Oh and this tent does SELL out all over the country by July of every year. Buy it now- I was scrambling in July and got one of the last ones. Yikes!\n",

You can walk around in it, have a large sleep area, room for your gear- I have a clothes line and throw my stuff over it in there, and get dressed no problem.I did the side by side comparison with the Springbar and for the extra $50 it's worth $100 more just for the larger windows, extra gear hangers, pockets and the 2 top air vents. The completely zip-sealable feature makes it a clean almost dust free sleep / storage area-get a cheap used carpet for your area- and go shoeless at the door when you can...It is so air tight that you can't raise it without unzipping the door and windows...as far as raising it- it takes about 15 minutes. Stake the corners, attach the bars, raise and stake the rest-2 people operation-but one tall strong person can do it on their own. Super fast. and the bonus? No guy lines! The tent comes with deep stakes, but I still recommend buying the deeper planting stakes at Sports Basement and also securing with at least 4 pieces of rebar. You will also need a to figure out how to cover it for shade. It's tall. One thing I bring with me to BRC? A small brush and dustpan from IKEA- they are usually around the check out area for a dollar. I sweep up the inside of my tent almost every day- takes a minute and I return to the default world with my tent needing very little maintenance.\n\nI am back from Symbiosis with 40+ mph winds on Thursday-and my tent took it with no problem. Yes the Kodiak is pricey, but they hold their value if you ever decide you want to sell it- they are rarely found used anywhere. Oh, and they sell out this time of year- apparently the Boy Scout Jamboree likes to buy a lot of these- so if you wait any longer you may be searching all over for one. Cabelas has them usually- I bought mine from some other dealer last year- no tax and free shipping. Check around. Good luck and see you in BRC!\n",

        "text": "After exhaustive research on e-playa and Tribe, I bought a Springbar Vagabond 4 before last years Burn. It was the best investment I made and I expect it to last for many years. It ran somewhere around $400. It is 8'X10' and 7' high. Perfect size tent for 1-2 people with all their stuff. There is plenty of room to divide the tent into living and sleeping spaces and it is really nice to be able to stand up. The Vagabond series is less expensive than their other models but extremely well made.\n\nSpringbars are really easy to put up. They are triple stitched, have industrial grade zippers and canvas walls that allow for air flow while being incredibly dust proof. I was pretty stoked about that after my experiences at the beginning of the 2008 burn while living in a cheapo but big $130 dustmaster deluxe tent I bought at Target. The Target dustmaster deluxe started ripping before I finished putting it up due to the wind picking up. Had to use duct tape and zip ties to keep it together. Then came the 8 hour monster dust storm and everything in my tent was covered with a layer of dust complements of the ventilation screens. It was a great way to start off my virgin burn. I took it in stride and made a mental note to get a better tent the next year.\n\nSpringbars do need to be staked down really well because it is part of the structural design. I used something like 12+ stakes but they will help hold the tent down during windstorms. I bought some 20\" steel stakes last year. They went into the ground way easier than rebar and you can bury the tops in the ground to avoid injuries. They were expensive but you can hammer them into asphalt and they will not bend. http://www.backcountrygear.com/catalog/ ... cfm/SN5100\n\nMy Vagabond 4 handled the wind incredibly well. I do recommend you get a little thing of lubricant for the zipper door because the dust will impact it a little over the week.",

Didn't budge at all in the wind, it was super stable. I kept it zipped up all the time and had zero issues with dust. I love my Springbar Tent.\n\nHowever, I had no shade or tarp over it. So by 8am it was an oven and I was out of it. I spent my days under a friends shade structure or at Centercamp. My tent became a place where I kept my stuff and slept. I spent very little waking time in it. ",

From all the favorable posts here and reviews on other web sites, I felt fairly certain that the Springbar brand was the tent I wanted. I also looked at the Kodiak at Sportsman's Warehouse. The Kodiaks are really high quality tents but I was told they were manufactured in China and I knew the Springbars are made in Utah. I went with the Springbar 10x10 Traveler 5. They had the tent at my gate in less than a week after ordering.\n\nEverything about the tent from fabric to poles is industrial strength heavy but that's ok because it isn't meant to be a backpacker tent. I put it up in about 15 minutes by myself the first time. I have absolutely no doubt it can withstand the playa conditions. I picked the 10x10 because of the headroom and it will fit nicely under the 10x20 costco.\n\nI also bought Snow Peak #50 ( 19.75\") solid steel tent stakes. The standard stakes included with the tent are good but I wanted the extra strength and length of the Snow Peaks and they also have very high reviews.\n\nI have no connection with Springbar other than being a very satisfied owner of one of their tents that should last longer than I will be around to use it.....

If I open all the windows, it can be cool enough to stay in there. The back window is huge, and covers a large portion of the rear wall. When I vent the doors and front window as well, I get good air flow going. I just have to be ready to zip up quickly if the wind picks up. In short, it's pretty decent in the sun, provided you can vent it all the way. Obviously, it will stay cooler if you have shade over it though.",

It’s unparalleled in the market at it’s price point of $199. It’s got a lifetime warranty, very good build quality, has 2 entrances with 2 very large vestibules, sheds water well*, has 2 nearly vertical walls for maximum interior space, has an extended length for tall people (awesome), and is decently light and compact. *Unfortunately though, there is a flaw in the fly design that places the main zipper seam above the entrance of the tent and if entering or exiting the tent while raining, some water is bound to get inside. In my opinion it is not a deal breaker, and especially if you’re unlikely be heading out for many trips with 100% chance of heavy rain for days at a time I’d still recommend it.",
